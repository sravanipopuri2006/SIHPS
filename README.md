## Idea
The Rapid Growth of electronic devices in modern society has led to a surge in electronic waste (e-waste), raising significant environmental and health concerns. To address this issue, an E-Waste Facility Locator is introduced as a vital digital tool. The integration of an E-Waste Facility Locator with additional features like drop-off locations, and collection events, enabling users to access crucial information, such as facility addresses, operating hours, accepted items, and contact details, cost estimation for electronic device recycling, a user-friendly GUI, and a comprehensive database is essential for promoting responsible e-waste management. The application can incorporate a WhatsApp chat integration and an email redirection system to enhance communication and accessibility for users. Furthermore, the inclusion of distinct databases for customers, sellers, and e-waste management universities would facilitate efficient information management and engagement within the platform. The E-Waste Facility Locator enhances environmental sustainability by encouraging proper disposal practices and reducing the harmful impact of e-waste on the environment. This holistic approach fosters a sustainable environment by encouraging proper e-waste

## Dependencies
Website: Our e-waste facility locator website features a user-friendly interface built with HTML, CSS, JS guaranteeing responsiveness, intuitiveness, and visual appeal across all devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones, ensuring accessibility across diverse platforms. Firebase Integration: Firebase, a comprehensive platform offered by Google, is integrated into our system to enhance user authentication, data storage, and real-time updates. Firebase Authentication ensures secure and seamless user authentication processes, allowing users to securely log in and access the system. Firebase Realtime Database and Authentication facilitates efficient data storage and retrieval, enabling our system to store user information, and other relevant data points. Real-time updates provided by Firebase ensure that users receive immediate feedback and notifications, enhancing the overall responsiveness and interactivity of the system. Map Integration: In our project, we integrated the TomTom Map API to enhance the functionality and user experience of our application. Leveraging the robust capabilities of the TomTom Map API, we incorporated a comprehensive search function that enables users to easily locate specific areas or points of interest within the map interface. Additionally, we implemented dynamic marker placement on the map, allowing users to visually identify and interact with relevant locations. As users input their search queries, the map automatically zooms to the designated area, providing a seamless and intuitive navigation experience. This integration not only enhances the usability of our application but also empowers users to efficiently explore and interact with geographic information tailored to their needs.
